Over the course of six weeks, I learned about the inner workings of deep learning models, how they can be attacked and exploited, and how to defend them with both preprocessing and postprocessing. This repository is all my code from this intern project with Clemson.

All models weights are hosted in a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uh2n8FtvBjPmflhmEoNO6oRBb-HcLNMt?usp=sharing), and their architecture is saved top level along with the number of epochs trained and which optimizer was used.
