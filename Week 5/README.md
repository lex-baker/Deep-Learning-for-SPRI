# Week 5

This week, we ran attacks, both defended and undefended, against our models that we created earlier in the week. These attacks were imported from the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox, an up-to-date python package that provides both attacks and defenses for PyTorch models. The final compilation of outputs is stored in [Week 6](/Week%206/README.md)
